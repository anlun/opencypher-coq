# opencypher-coq
A Coq formalizaton of "Formalizing openCypher Graph Queries in Relational Algebra" [Marton-al:ADBIS17]

## Building 
You must have `opam` [installed](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

For an easy start run:
```
./make_switch.sh
```
This will create a local `opam` switch, configure repositories, and install all the dependencies.
